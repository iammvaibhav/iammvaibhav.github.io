I’m enjoying some free time as there’s a month gap between when my internship ended at Cityflo and my joining as a full-time Software engineer at AppDynamics.

During this time, quite a chunk went into developing this blog.


I’m also trying to sort my routine a bit by adopting a healthy lifestyle. I thought of three simple things to start with
* Sleep on time and wake up early
* Stop using screen 30mins before sleep
* Exercise at least a half-hour everyday

I'll update on how it goes.
