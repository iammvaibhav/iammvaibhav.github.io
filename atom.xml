It’s my first anniversary today, and many more to come till the day I die. Yeah, that’s the bond we’ve formed in such a short time, a bond that I humbly believe won’t break ever. Looking back at the past year, it has been a ride full of exhilaration as well as some self-doubt but one thing I can say for sure is that it has been one of the best damn journeys I’ve ever embarked on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m celebrating my one-year lifting journey! 🎉 &lt;/p>
&lt;p>16th November 2021 - The day when it all began. I had been trying to adopt a healthy lifestyle for the longest time as 12 hours sitting in front of the computer wasn’t making my body very happy (and of course, I wanted to have those abs and a perfect beach body). The problem was me being me, who wanted to stay away from any physical activity whatsoever wasn’t on board with the idea of going to the gym. It was when one of my close friends joined the gym (who was even a bigger couch potato than I was) that made me ponder “If she can do it, what’s stopping me?”. As silly as it might sound, that was the foundation of my lifting journey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://vmwrites.com/images/chilly_winters.png" alt="Chilly Winters of Ajmer">
&lt;figcaption style="color: grey; text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Wrapped from head to toe in the chilly winters of December 2020, heading towards the gym at 6:00 am wintry morning. It used to be dark and temperatures used to be as low as 5 degrees. I used to sleep by 9:30 pm, wake up by 4:30 am, have my pre-workout meal at 5:00 am, and leave by 6:00 am. From sleeping at 4:30 am to waking up at 4:30 am, lifting certainly made me do some crazy stuff.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>After arriving home, my upper body was in a lot of pain! I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to move, raise my arms, or do anything. I also took a day off from the office.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That’s an excerpt from the first week of the weekly workout check-ins that I decided to do when I started going to the gym (of course, I didn’t do any after the first week). I remember my mom massaging me using Iodex to relieve that pain :D It’s funny how my life changed remarkably just a week after joining the gym. I used to be in constant soreness, my days used to revolve all around lifting and diet, and my daily knowledge consumption shifted from tech to fitness. I spent weeks after weeks learning about exercises, body anatomy, stimulus, structuring diet, and whatnot - basically how the whole fitness domain works and I had some big enlightenments that completely changed the way how I look at fitness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Out of all the things that I learnt, the one thing that stood out was the realisation that &lt;strong>I am in complete control of my body.&lt;/strong> Now why this seemingly simple fact was such a big eye-opener for me because before getting into fitness, I was under the impression that transformations happen somehow via magic or at least something that you don’t have much control over. For instance, I used to think that if you’re overweight, you have to run and exercise and “hope” that you’ll lose weight. Wait, what? As a software engineer, I’m used to logic and deterministic behaviour, not “hope” that things will work (Okay, I still hope for my code to work but we’ll not get into that). And part of the reason why I formed this opinion was that whenever I had tried making a change to my body, I had failed miserably. As a super skinny kid, I tried gaining weight, and fast-forward a few years to my college days, I started running to lose weight. Both times, I failed and frustrated, I stopped trying altogether and went back to my inactive lifestyle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://vmwrites.com/images/food.png" alt="Diet">
&lt;figcaption style="color: grey; text-align: center; font-style: italic;">A glimpse of how I managed to ingest ~150g of protein a day for the past year. Being a vegetarian, it&amp;#39;s a little tricky to complete the protein intake but it&amp;#39;s very doable if you include whey protein. I must have eaten more paneer &amp;amp; soya chunks in the past year than all of the years combined before that. If you think working out is the difficult part, try eating &amp;gt;3000Cal a day for a few months and that might change your mind.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>* Drumroll * To my relief, that’s not how things work. I learnt that there’s a very structured approach to fitness &amp;amp; body transformations and the best part is, there’s no luck involved! If you’re willing to put in the effort, you are gonna get the results. No hidden clauses, no asterisks, and no terms and conditions! How cool is that, right? Now that realisation was like a superpower that I gained. And using that superpower, I set my goals and gained 10+ Kgs in the first 8 months and lost 10+ Kgs in the last 4 months. If you’re curious why I did this ping pong of gaining and losing (No, it wasn’t just to try out the superpower although I now know that it works), the technical term is bulking (for gaining muscle) and cutting (for losing fat) and this is something bodybuilders do all the time. Oh yes, I won’t shy away from calling myself a bodybuilder, albeit a budding one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://vmwrites.com/images/sbd.png" alt="Squat Bench Deadlift">
&lt;figcaption style="color: grey; text-align: center; font-style: italic;">The Big Three - Squats, Bench, and Deadlifts. I unquestionably love doing these lifts. One might argue that these aren&amp;#39;t the best for hypertrophy but will that 10% optimization even matter if you don&amp;#39;t enjoy doing what you do and eventually give up?&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lifting has become an integral part of my life now. It’s something that I look forward to every single day, something that brightens up my day no matter what I’m going through, and something that gives me energy and peace at the same time. I had some euphoric moments throughout the last year, for instance, the first time when I was finally able to do pull-ups. It was a big win for me that day, and the starting of vmlifts!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The best thing about lifting is that you can see yourself grow. You’ll fail, train, and finally succeed! And then the process repeats. There’s no destination, once you reach your targets, further targets open up to be achieved. And that’s the beauty of lifting that correlates to most of the things in life. This lifting journey has truly been an eye-opener for me that has taught me a lot of things - the power of perseverance, hard work, being honest with yourself, and self-discipline. You won’t see visible results in days, weeks, or maybe even months but the one who perseveres is eventually gonna reap the benefits. There will be days when you won’t feel like training no matter how motivated you usually are, and there will be days when you’ll think of giving up on your diet. But if you can still persevere through these hurdles, I would say you have truly won over yourself! And there’s no one you can credit or blame for anything, you’ll own the success, and you have to own the failure as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To myself and everyone who’s trying to be a better version of themselves, be it achieving their dream physique, or their most ambitious career goals - Trust the process, we all are gonna make it!&lt;/p>
